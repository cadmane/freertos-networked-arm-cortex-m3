Ethernet Boot Loader Demo

An example to demonstrate the use of remote update signaling with the
flash-based Ethernet boot loader.  This application configures the Ethernet
controller and acquires an IP address which is displayed on the screen
along with the board's MAC address.  It then listens for a ``magic packet''
telling it that a firmware upgrade request is being made and, when this
packet is received, transfers control into the boot loader to perform the
upgrade.

Although there are three flavors of flash-based boot loader provided with
this software release (boot_serial, boot_eth and boot_usb), this example is
specific to the Ethernet boot loader since the magic packet used to trigger
entry into the boot loader from the application is only sent via Ethernet.

The boot_demo1 and boot_demo2 applications do not make use of the Ethernet
magic packet and can be used along with this application to easily
demonstrate that the boot loader is actually updating the on-chip flash.

Note that the LM3S9B96 and other Tempest-class Stellaris devices also
support serial and ethernet boot loaders in ROM in silicon revisions B1 or
later.  To make use of this function, link your application to run at
address 0x0000 in flash and enter the bootloader using either the
ROM_UpdateEthernet or ROM_UpdateSerial functions (defined in rom.h).  This
mechanism is used in the utils/swupdate.c module when built specifically
targeting a suitable Tempest-class device.
